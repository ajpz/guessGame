Overview

The guessing game is a simple web application in which a user tries
to guess a number between 1 and 100. 

The user will be given a limited number of guesses, and provided 
proximity hints along the way.

Development

The project will be developed in two stages: 
1) HTML and CSS layout and design
2) javascript powered game logic thereafter
